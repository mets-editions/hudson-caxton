        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/hudson-caxton/blob/main/hudson-caxton-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <p style="appendix-headnote1">This prologue appears in all manuscripts of the long version but in none of the manuscripts or prints of the short version, including Caxton’s. The following translation is based on Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, MS fr. 1480.<note target="#1" type="footnotelink">G</note></p>
 <ab>Alanus, who was most wise,<note target="#2" type="footnotelink">G</note>  has written in the book of his doctrines an axiom which says in Latin, “<hi rend="italic">Hoc crede quod tibi verum esse videtur</hi>,”<note target="#3" type="footnotelink">G</note>  and would furthermore say that this maxim, is translated out of Latin into French: “<hi rend="italic">Tu croyras les chouses qui te resembleront estre veritables</hi>.” I undertake this theme in the present case because I have all my life taken pleasure in the reading romances and chronicles of the ancient histories, as of the life of Lancelot, of Tristan, of Florimond, of Guy of Warwick, who performed many brave acts in their life according to what I have found written. And many things I have found there which are very impossible to believe. And many other books I have seen, but among them I have chosen a book, written in the Provençal language, which was drawn from another book written in the Catalan language. This book contains the life of a baron who was called Godfrey d’Alencon, who was dauphin of Vienne, who had a daughter who was called Vienne, who was a paragon of beauty. And how a knight who was called Paris, son of a baron who was named messire Jacques, was enamored of the said Vienne so that for love of her he did in his life many great deeds, as you will hear later. And because the matter is reasonable and credible enough, and also because the story is quite pleasing — for it is a good thing to hear recounted the great deeds of the ancients in times past — I undertake to translate the history for you from Provençal into French. I would request and beg all those who read the said book, that if they find written there anything which is not well done, that they will pardon my defects and amend them according to their good judgment, for my ability is not sufficient to that which is needed to well treat it [the material], and also for I am not French by birth but was born and raised in the city of Marseilles. And if it pleases you to know that from Saint Pierre I take my name, of the Cypède for surname, and commenced to write this book in the year of our lord 1432, the third day of the month of September.</ab>
