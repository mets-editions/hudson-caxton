        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>
        <correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in
            order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and

            greatly hearing Blanchardyn speak. So graciously did he converse that the knight was
            amazed that the young knight could already have so many virtues, such as excellent
            beauty, graciousness, prudence, so that at this occasion he could not refrain from
            telling Blanchardyn, “Would that it pleased God, sir, that my mistress, <hi

            would be your desire and obligation to defend her against King Alimodes.” Blanchardyn
            then responded to the knight and said to him, “Sir, I thank you for the goodness and the
            honor that you do me, but I know well enough that such a great bounty is not due to me.
            And it would be presumptuous for me to think of it, seeing that, as you say, so many

          <foreign xml:lang="en">and the other barons, who led with them a great plenty of prisoners, to force them into
          the courtyard. Then the proud pucelle in amours, seeing that her friend Blanchardyn was
          not come, she called the earl and asked him where Blanchardyn and Sadoyne were. “Madame,”
          said the earl, “it is not long since that they were with us, so I don’t know where they
          went nor do I know at what point they turned, for indeed we thought that they were coming
          to you.”</foreign></ab>
        <ab><milestone n="2" unit="prose-textblock"/><foreign xml:lang="en">When the noble damsel heard the earl and the
          provost who was there, who knew no tidings of the barons, from so high a place as she was
          she fell to the ground, calling out a very loud and piteous cry. Then those who had been
          taken there had great sorrow, for all thought that she was dead because in her they sensed
          no pulse nor breath. A pitiful thing it was to see the gentle countess and the other
          people who were there, but soon after the proud pucelle in amours came to herself, casting
          a deep sigh, then very piteously she began to complain, lamenting her true love
          Blanchardyn. There was no man or woman there who had such a hard heart that they did not
          have pity on her.</foreign></ab>
        <ab><milestone n="3" unit="prose-textblock"/><foreign xml:lang="en">The good earl and the good countess comforted
          her as best they could, but it did no good; her sorrow began to strengthen more and more.
          They led her to a chamber, and when she was come there they led her to a couch to lie
          down. The countess and the ladies were milling about grieving and tearful because they
          could not at all console her, for she did not ever, for a moment, cease to make the most
          piteous and anguished complaints for her true love whom she thought to have lost. But
          hardly was there any delay before her plaints would be turned back joy, as you will hear
          later.</foreign></ab>
        <ab><milestone n="4" unit="prose-textblock"/><foreign xml:lang="en">Blanchardyn and Sadoyne, who were in the
          dwelling of the thieves, where they found Subyon in a chamber where he was hiding, but
          little did it profit him, for when the two vassals saw him there, the joy which they were
          in was very great. They took and seized him and tied him hand and foot, then put him on a
          strong horse which they found there. Then they quickly bounded out of the place, and
          taking their destriers on which they mounted, set themselves on the way to Castelford,
          which was two leagues from there. Sadoyne went before and Subyon after, and Blanchardyn
          followed closely behind. The moon shone bright and clear, so the horses sped that in a
          little time they were before the gate of Castelford, which was closed. They began to call
          loudly, making themselves known.</foreign></ab>
        <ab><milestone n="5" unit="prose-textblock"/><foreign xml:lang="en">When their coming was known, from all parts
          they came running to open up for them, and as soon as they entered there they dismounted
          at the stone pavement before the hall. Subyon was put in a very dark prison and was never
          otherwise since the hour that he had been taken; well he knew that he was sentenced to
          death. After the two barons entered there, their coming was announced to the proud pucelle
          in amours who had of it great joy as you could know well enough. Soon all her tears and
          regrets were changed to perfect joy and happiness. She raised herself in great haste, but
          no sooner was she up than Blanchardyn and Sadoyne came toward her, of which the joy was
          redoubled, for before all she kisses and embraces her love. They spoke together of many
          things. The joy, the recollections, and the great love which Blanchardyn made for the good
          earl of Castelford, to the provost, and to the knight of the ferry, with the sweet thanks,
          they would be too long if I wanted to recite them. But for the cause of brevity I will
          omit these. They passed the night.</foreign></ab>
        <ab><milestone n="6" unit="prose-textblock"/><foreign xml:lang="en">Then when came the morning, they made
          themselves ready and mounted their horses, taking their way toward Tormaday where their
          coming was already known. The good king of Frise, father of Blanchardyn, and all those of
          the town went before together with all the confraternities<note type="enote-indicator"
            n="104">N</note> of the city with crosses and standards to receive their lady and
          Blanchardyn who must be their lord. Very great joy and great celebration they made when
          they came together with them. The town was all hung and decked and strewn with fresh
          boughs; in the streets ladies and damsels of the town and maidens were at the windows
          singing and comporting themselves with joy. There were many and diverse instruments which
          sent forth melodious sounds. They rode on horseback to the palace where they all
          dismounted. Very great joy was manifest there.</foreign></ab>
        <ab><milestone n="7" unit="prose-textblock"/><foreign xml:lang="en">After all were settled, by the council of the
          princes and so likewise by all those of the realm, Blanchardyn betrothed the beautiful
          proud pucelle in amours. Then, when the next morning came, the proud pucelle in amours was
          led to the cathedral accompanied by two kings, that is to say, of the king of Frise and of
          the king Sadoyne, and by the bishop of the city the two lovers were married and were
          crowned as king and queen of the kingdom of Tourmaday. Very grand and noble was the
          offering at the wedding mass.</foreign></ab>
        <ab><milestone n="8" unit="prose-textblock"/><foreign xml:lang="en">After the mass was complete, they returned to
          the palace where the tables were set up. Water was poured,<note type="enote-indicator"
            n="105">N</note> and then they sat down to eat. Of the elaborate dishes and courses
          accompanied by entertainments, I will not make a long account, for very richly were they
          served of all that could satisfy the human body. Of the clothing and ornaments of which
          the bride and groom were adorned or dressed it is not possible to tell you. But indeed I
          dare say to you that never before or since this could one have or seen or known of more
          rich jewels or garments than on the two lovers were, for they were both so beautiful that
          God and nature could do nothing to improve them. Then after they had dined, tournament
          jousts, dances, and amusements began. Then afterwards, when it was the time and hour for
          supper, they seated themselves to eat. As they had been well served at dinner, so they
          were at supper.</foreign></ab>
        <ab><milestone n="9" unit="prose-textblock"/><foreign xml:lang="en">When the supper was finished and it was time
          for them all to retire, the two lovers were led to a chamber where they went to bed
          together and conceived that night a son who in his time had the name Rambault the
            Frisian,<note type="enote-indicator" n="106">N</note> the which made and achieved many
          and great deeds of prowess and died in the very piteous battle of Roncevaux, with Roland
          and Oliver, who if you would know more of them, look in his history which of them makes
          mention, and we will return to our subject. When the next day came, all within the palace
          got up and the festivities began again, which lasted one whole day.</foreign></ab>
        <ab><milestone n="10" unit="prose-textblock"/><foreign xml:lang="en">After the solemnity of the celebrations and
          the wedding were passed, by the commandment of King Blanchardyn, Subyon and all his
          accomplices were put to death. Soon afterwards the barons of the kingdom of Frise arrived
          in Tourmaday to see the king their lord and the king Blanchardyn his son, of which the joy
          was strengthened. But when the good king knew and was well informed that the queen his
          wife was gone from this transitory world, then he greatly mourned for her, and so did the
          king Blanchardyn, who was very sad and grieved by this. But there is no sorrow so great
          that it should not finally come to an end. Notwithstanding this, the good king of Frise,
          for whatever comfort that one knew to offer him, he did not leave his sorrow; and so much
          so that of the great affliction that he had, he took to his sick-bed and died. The king
          Blanchardyn his son was in very keen unhappiness, and also the queen his wife who lamented
          greatly. He was buried, and his service and obsequies made, as fitting for a king.</foreign></ab>
        <ab><milestone n="11" unit="prose-textblock"/><foreign xml:lang="en">After all the calamities and misfortunes of
          Blanchardyn and of his lady, as king and queen, replete and adorned of all good virtues,
          they lived the remainder of their life in peace and tranquility in the service of God,
          loved and respected by their neighbors, and had such grace of our Lord that before they
          departed the world they saw their son great in bearing arms and they made him to be
          crowned king of Frise. And they lived a very long time, in ruling them in this world, such
          that after their death they were greatly missed by their subjects, neighbors, and others
          who did not know them, so great was the renown of their life. In such a way they conducted
          themselves in this transitory world that they found peace in the kingdom of heaven. And
          Sadoyne, his loyal companion, returned to Cassydonye where he and the queen Beatrice lived
          in tranquility of soul and body.</foreign></ab>

          about the reign of the king Blanchardyn, nor of the queen his wife. So we will finish our
          history, praying to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, that at the end of our days we might
          attain His grace. Amen.</foreign></ab>
