        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/hudson-caxton/blob/main/hudson-caxton-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <p style="bodyfirst">Thanks are due to many people whose time, efforts, and expertise have made this edition possible. As the saying goes, “it takes a village . . .”. While I produced drafts, these were “raised” by the instruction of scholars and the correction of editors to produce a volume useful to teachers and students of Middle English Literature.</p>
 <p style="body">I am grateful for the support of the Editorial Board of the Middle English Texts Series and the diligent work of its Editorial Staff members who did multiple read-throughs of the texts, glosses, and notes at various stages of the editorial process. Pamela Yee, Managing Editor, patiently guided me every step of the way, reading copy, fielding questions, and coordinating the project. I am indebted to the accuracy of Staff Editors Caleb Prus and Steffi Delcourt who read my transcriptions against the British Library and Rylands Library incunables and checked the Textual Notes. I especially want to recognize Steffi’s early work on the manuscript read of <hi rend="italic">Blanchardyn and Eglantine</hi>, and on formatting the text and entering corrections. She and staff members, Eleanor Price and Ashley Conklin, meticulously edited the citations. Readers on the Editorial Board reviewed complete drafts of the edition; Alan Lupack and General Editor Russell Peck read drafts and copy-edited the entire volume, with Alan giving special attention to the glosses and Pamela handling further corrections and emendations. All their work would not have been possible without the continuing support of the National Endowment for the Humanities, which assists with the funding of the Middle English Texts Series.</p>
 <p style="body">In addition to the people at METS, other readers reviewed drafts of the whole volume and commented on the content of the Introductions and Editorial Notes. I owe special thanks to the outside reviewers, whose responses were thorough and very helpful, particularly in regard to recent scholarship on critical race theory. Their expertise is deeply appreciated. Thanks are due to my friend and colleague, Kristen Figg, who read drafts of the Introductions, reviewed my translations from French sources, helped to decipher signatures in the manuscripts, and enabled me to obtain copies of essential publications. John Block Friedman was instrumental in identifying an early owner of <hi rend="italic">Blanchardyn and Eglantine</hi>. I especially want to acknowledge my husband, Richard Knittle, for his many years of support for my academic endeavors and this project.</p>
 <p style="body">This edition was made possible by the resources of The Ohio State University Library and by the digital copies of unique surviving texts at the British Library and John Rylands Library.</p>
